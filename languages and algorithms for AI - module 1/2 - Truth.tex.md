# Truth

First of all, we re-define **truth**: basically being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard. Truth is usually associated to the sensible world: you observe an experiment, if it is repeatable than you have *truth*. For example, you throw a ball to the ground, it is true that it falls because it always will.

In mathematics, we have truth in, for example, *The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is $180$Â°*, but this becomes false in spherical geometry! The consequences are that the **axiomatic method is not a description of the sensible world**. The conclusion is that we **should replace the notion of pure truth** by the notion of **logical consequence**. The important one is the latter, which is based on the notion of truth. 

In mathematics, we can state that **a statement is true in a specific world, described by a specific axiom**. Rather than focusing on the **absolute** notion of truth, we focuse on a **relative** notion of truth, being relative on a set of axioms, i.e. a model where these axioms are true. Then, rather than talking about general truth, we are interested in the truth with respect to those axioms.

Now, let $\Gamma = F_1, \dots, F_n$ we say that $F$ is a logical consequence of $\Gamma$, written as $\Gamma|=F$, if it is always true that for each world in which all the formulas in $\Gamma$ are true, also $F$ is true. In other terms, whenever all the sentences in $\Gamma$ are true, $F$ is true too. We're not interested in knowing whether $F$ is always true, just in its world. 

Therefore, **truth is always defined with respect to a world** and a **given intepretation of symbols** in that world. We are not interested in the truth of a single sentence, but in the truth with respect to a set of other sentences, i.e. a **logical consequence**. 

## Syntax, semantics, rules

In general, for every system we distinguish **syntax** from **semantics**: the first being rules which tell us **how  sentences are formed**, the latter being the rules which tell us the **meaning of well formed sentences**.

How can we define a syntax? In many ways like informal (e.g. in natural language, for example, it is subject/verb/etc...), BNF, and inductive definitions.

So, how can we define semantics? Basically, if we take C (the language) as an example, what's the meaning of a *for statement*? In order to precisely define the semantics, we use many different methods, like operational semantics, denotational semantics, logical semantics... These are not being teached anymore (*bella*), but they are starting to being used at high levels too.

We have two main realms for semantics: **model theory** (concerning what is true) and **proof theory** (concerning what is provable). Hopefully, the two coincide. 

Propositional logic is the simplest logic, concerning propositions, i.e. statements about a reality which can be true or false. Who defines what is true and false? *Our specific interpretation*.

Now, we all know what propositional logic is (*do we?*), but how do we put propositions together? Using **connectives** (or, and, if...). Propositional logic uses a very restricted set of connectives, because we want to be precise. 

One should be careful, though, because the ordering of propositions may be crucial: *John drove on and hit a pedestrian* is very different from *John hit a pedestrian and drove on*. 

So, we need to create an artificial language with precise meanings: an **alphabet for propositional logic**, which contains a countable set of symbols <img src="svgs/64258665045232115741ed193231351f.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=91.52194259999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>, connectives AND , OR, <img src="svgs/e5d134f35dc4949fab12ec64d186248a.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=16.43840384999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>(implication), <img src="svgs/43c24ae4490ffb3a4e8e30d0250ffd2c.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=16.43840384999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>(double implication), <img src="svgs/23bf728170c10d0449b90561f827623a.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=10.95894029999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> negation, _ disjunction.

The propositions are also called atoms. 

Now, how do we define well-formed formulas? First of all, 

- **an atom is a formula** (atom=any propositional formula)

- All well-formed formulas are formed by applying the above rules

The Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defines formulas analytically.

The third definition (100% precise) defines by induction: we have three rules, which define the set <img src="svgs/cbfb1b2a33b28eab8a3e59464768e810.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=14.908688849999992pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>.
